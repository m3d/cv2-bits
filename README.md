Bits of code using OpenCV2 in Python

Here you can see some of my experiment with OpenCV. They are not big enough to have it's own repository,
but I feel the need to keep history, and one day I may use/improve them. This are mostly "hacked bits"
or "quick and dirty" ... but still somebody may find some inspiration there.

The code looks horribe?
Yes, you are right ... now.
